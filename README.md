# CWEM-9.01
CWEM is the successor to MEM.  CWEM can simulate the growth of mangrove trees, hence the name change. 
There is a user guide that explains the parameter inputs required to run the model.  CWEM comes with hard wired estuaries that you may select by highlighting a radio button. The model is free to download and ready to use.
